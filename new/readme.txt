The Project implements DQN algorithm for RL on Pacman.

To run the project open cmd/terminal, traverse to project directory and run the following command:

python pacmanAgent.py -n 5000 -x 4900

-n is total iteration, -x is training iterations
To just test the program you can try:


python pacmanAgent.py -n 50 -x 49


Requirements: 	Python 3.6.8
		Tensorflow 1.14
		And other minor dependencies
